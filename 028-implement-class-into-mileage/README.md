#Implement Class Into Mileage

#So far I have created APP_DATA which is based on MY_DATA. I passed in miles, gallons, and price. I have also set up setters and getters for miles, gallons, and price. Check it out! I can't really check it yet as I am not sure how to implement it completely, definitely looking foward to seeing how we will do that.
