#Implement Class Into Mileage

#So far I have created APP_DATA which is based on MY_DATA. I passed in miles, gallons, and price. I have also set up setters and getters for miles, gallons, and price. Check it out! I can't really check it yet as I am not sure how to implement it completely, definitely looking foward to seeing how we will do that.

#Where will we implement? 
#I'm pretty sure we'll implement it in our main.js file. It is where most of our code is aside from functions, render, and storage code. It is also where MY_DATA is located

#Broken things:
#NaN is listed when app is supposed to show averages 
#Edit Button does not work
#I attempted to import Trip into the render.js file in order to be able to reference our getters, but it seems I am missing some steps. I also included some of our updatedom functions in our Trip.js file. I was hoping that I would be able to reference our getters locally but I realize that it probably need more work than that.
