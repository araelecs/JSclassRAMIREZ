#Intro to OOP

#Hey Rio, I understand the difference in syntax, but I still don't see why we would use this instead of our original method. I guess I will have to see when we start to include it in the code later on.

#Student class subclass and the subtype chain make a bit more sense to me now. I can definitely see this way being a lot more organized than our original method. I can see this being useful when referencing specific categories in a big app. I assume this is one way to be a bit more organized and allow devs to target more objects. 

#For the challenge, I was able to set getters and setters. I did figure out that we did not get "undefined" for our first name as we had established and used a getter and setter. I then added getters to the remaining elements of our console.log call and it eliminated the undefined error. However, now it displays code instead. I think this is a step towards the right direction though

#ALMOST had it, I had forgotten to add () to the end of the getters :P

#It now works, I had also forgotten to create a setter and getter for our classlist. It is 100% working now! I just have to make sure not to forget the (), it keep forgetting them. Thanks Rio!
