#Week 8 User Input
#Sometimes websites ask for my phone number is a specific format, it is annoying when it does not format the number with dashes, but does not mention that you need to add the dashes to the phone number. Some websites want spaces between the area code and phone number, which can be annoying. 

#I assume that we will be using arrays once again to store the input that is received thanks to the newly coded event listener. Then we will use our existing code to find our averages and costs using the input from users, which we will be pulling from the arrays created.
