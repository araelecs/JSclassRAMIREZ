#Week 12 Higher Order Functions

#Notes
#Trending more due to react
#HOF= functions that accepts nother function as parameter or returns a function after it is done
#setTimeout waits a bit and then carried out operations after a while (cant tell it what to do with primitive, must use function)
#array.filter() helps filter any array, ex: filter all arrays that start with Q (once again, cant do with primitive)
#repetition is a red flag?
#array.map, have an array of data and converts it into a list of jsx elements. Use a HOF and combine with first order functions (non-higher order function)
#Leads to smaller functions (more organized, nice!)
#function factory is not the same is factory function
#write the logic once, and then apply the function to individual functions

#My attempt
#I have updated my code by adding our sums constant to our average MPG and average cost constants. That seemed to have fixed our first issue. The code runs, but I have not been able to identify how to change the code, it displays not a number. I tried to get it to display the value of our constants, but it did not solve the issue.
