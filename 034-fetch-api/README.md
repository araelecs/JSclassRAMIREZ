#Yes, I do tend to go into live server and test my code. I started doing it more often when I thought I had everything correct, but then found some errors on devtools. It may appear to be fine in VSCode, but some errors are highlighted by devtools, which can make fixing code a lot easier.

#Notes
#Fetch came to browsers between 2015-17. Includes browsers such as chrome, firefox, edge, and safari
#Everything mentioned applies to node 18 and beyond
#Tends to be built-in 
#XHR/XmlHTTPRequest is an alternative, you can find filters for this or fetch in devtools
#You can see it in action when a request is made to a server
#HTTP Request is request from client to server (literally everything basically)
#Benefits of fetch: Native, why do third party? Support modern apps. Based on promises instead of callbacks (I remember callbacks!)
#Basically does everything XHR, but neater
