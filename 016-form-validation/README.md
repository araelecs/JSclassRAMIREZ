#The if else section 100% makes sense to me (mainly because I remember from last semester lol)

#I was not able to clear the code. I attempted to clear the length of the array, errorMessage by setting its length equal to 0 after the error was corrected, but it did not work. Sometimes one of the two error messages would dissapear, but never both. 

#I assume that In order to get the average, we have to save the amount of times trips were made in an array, add up all of our prices, and then divide the number by the number of trips we made

#I like to watch you code, but at the same time I felt like you explained your code in more detail when you show off your completed code, both work for me 

#One thing that confused me was the "output-avg" ID, I know you mentioned it made the code work better

#Learning about branching would be cool, I love being able to repurpose code
